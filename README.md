Haven is an open-source, centralized secrets manager. It protects your application secrets through a combination of encryption, access control, and injection-at-runtime. It’s easy to set up, and offers an intuitive GUI to set fine-grained access controls and to view logs. Haven allows small teams to securely manage all of their projects’ secrets---and to do so with a minimum of hassle so that they can get back to developing their applications without sacrificing security.

## Usage

This is the core package used by [Haven CLI][haven-cli] and [Haven UI][haven-ui] to connect to the AWS services used to provide the secret manager functionality. To use Haven, install either of those and follow the instructions there.
